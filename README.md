# Guess Again
Using basic python functionality to create a basic games called "Guess Again". In this made up game, 3 random  numbers will be selected from a list from 1:10. We will then get the average of those numbers. Once we have this average we allow the program to select 3 numbers and the player does so as well: Points will be given out as follows:

2 points - guessing the average perfectly   
1 point - guessing within 1.5 of the random average  
0.5 points - guessing within 2.5 of the avergae   
0 points - guessing outside 2.5 of the avergae 

In this notebook project we will aim to: 

- Create the game "Guess Again" by making a basic Python function.
- Explore the use of new packages like `random`.
